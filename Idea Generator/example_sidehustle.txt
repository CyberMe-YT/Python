Content: I can imagine how often you hear this but I need good ideas for side hustles

 hustling as a disabled teenager. 
I have recently been doing 10 dollar window cleaning and it pays well, especially with tips. But eventually you run out of windows to clean because most people do it only 2-3 times a year. 

As I said I'm disabled and looking for a good way to make some cash.

For context I'm looking for something everyone wants in my local neighborhood. Something that doesn't require me to lug around a lot, and something that could be a good door to door sales pitch 

If it helps to know what disability I have it's basically Cerebral palsy, not bad but I have little use of my left arm.

Thanks for the ideas in advance :)

I hate how financial apps usually track my data, so I built it in such a way that no data ever leaves your device. Everything you enter stays locally on your device and you can export / import data in order to move them across devices. What do you think? Appreciating any feedback on it.

Comment by Vox_Shadow: Video Platforms such as twitch, YouTube and even shorts such as Instagram and YouTube shorts will be the best way to monetize your passion. 

Other people will also find it interesting and you build a community. They key is to not just to make money off YouTube, but to build a community to leverage this passion into income..

Create a discord community and as you build your following, create tshirts and mugs, general mech applicable to your passion and community. 

With this, it's possible to turn this into a full time passion but it's also a creative pursuit. 

Why don't you want to use YouTube?

Comment by picitize: I was watching kings and generals before 10k subs. Bazbattles and historyMarche too. They cover the battles and give geopolitical context. K&G were advertising a course on Linda.com they said they took to learn better mapmaking. If you‚Äôd taken it all those years ago your channel might be the size of theirs. Advice, start today, learn to make maps. It‚Äôs a great starting point even if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going to make your channel about yet.

Sandroman history is another semi-big one. Production value is lower but the view count is higher - he focuses on weapons armament and tactics. Fewer, longer videos. Focus on a niche could be a strat? I‚Äôd love someone to go in as much depth about the economics of countries as they do about battles and heroes. That‚Äôs my thing - can you find your the ‚Äúmy thing‚Äù of a few thousand people?

Peak history is that guy who posts every few years. He did the Sea Peoples one and it was fire.I like that he questions a lot but the answer he suggests is never ‚Äúaliens‚Äù.

Last but serious point - get a Brit on fiverr to narrate it. Make sure you have all the rights including ai rights to his voice and in a year you won‚Äôt need the actor anymore.

Publish a few articles, engage with others, and find the best history publication on Medium to submit your articles to.

A You Tube channel could also work. Check out similar channels to see how many views and subscribers they have.

 You could look into medical deliveries too,  there are a bunch of different apps for different areas I wouldn't know which to recommend.  But if you look up 'medical courier driver' on youtube you'll find a ton of videos talking about how it all works and what it pays etc.  Sounded like it could be decent but might need a truck or a van to get the best pay. 

 And its not a driving job but If you're handy there's also Taskrabbit, there's all kinds of random jobs on there you can sign up to do.  A lot of thrm are easy and sometimes they pay pretty well. Recently I found out they've even added a section for remote jobs on there now.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated
Comments:
Comment by dylpickle300: Here is some advice.

Pick a hobby and lean into it. All hobbies can be turned into businesses.

For example, I like keyboards. I spend a lot of my time at home in from of my computer for both work and play. I use my keyboard every day. So customizing it was an easy hobby to pick up. I made some keycaps and posted them online. Years later it‚Äôs a full side hustle that makes good money.

Taking this approach helps in 2 ways

1. Exploring a hobby that you find interesting
2. Staying disciplined and motivated when you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to do it‚Äù

Comment by DemiseofReality: Learn some basic carpentry and offer custom built basic shelves for people. How many people have an awkward small space where they could use a small shelf or a working surface but nothing fits the bill? You make the client provide you the exact dimensions they need then you bill a modest hourly rate + materials, hopefully at a price range that is a bit more expensive than Amazon or Ikea or Wayfair but close enough to make the customization worth it. Your shelves have zero contractor provided install, they are delivered as ordered with no modifications. Price it such that you can do a few hours of projects per work day and profit some hundreds to maybe 1k/month.

Comment by Adventurous_Time8704: Try selling digital products with MRR. It's trending business right now and even complete beginners like myself are seeing success. I‚Äôve tried it all. This is the first thing I‚Äôve found that actually works for me. I would suggest taking a look at what you‚Äôre passionate about and what you have some experience in and start there. You can create a digital product about anything and then use free social media accounts to drive traffic to your offer or sell ones already done for you.

Content: So i have been trading for over 15 years, over the years I was able to develop a system which delivers 90% insane win rates consistently (scalping) documented in our free discorx community every day for last 2 +years.

And 60-70% win rates on swings. You can ask me any good or stupid questions.

Before hate brigade comes on, this is your answer here I have no paid services No course selling No private brokers Since there is no paid service Of any kind so there is no scam going on, save your negative energy.

I do have 100% free discord server which aims to finish signal selling groups and paid services, so people don't get scammed by them.

I am sure many beginners will feel this is a dream win rate (which it is but trust me doable).

I don't sell signals, i don't have any paid services, i just genuinely want to help trading community who is stuck in paid signals and fake gurus all around, You don't need to pay anyone anything to trade. As crazy as it sounds we did not hit a single stop loss on oil for over a year in over 50+ trades, again sound crazy right? But its doable.

Last 3 weeks aboutn15 signals on gold with 0 sl.

Don't give up, don't lose hope, there is light at the end of tunnel. Attaching last 3 weeks win tracker of our¬†free¬†discors server

My energy goes into sharing what I've learned over 15 years of trading to help others avoid costly mistakes and scams.

Comment by realtrademaster: To start learning trading, focus on building a strong foundation in market basics: understand charts, candlestick patterns, and price action. Begin with a demo account to practice without real risk. Follow reputable sources for market analysis and learn about risk management, including position sizing and stop-loss strategies. Avoid paid courses or signal services; instead, explore free resources like YouTube tutorials, online articles, and trading forums. As you progress, join a supportive trading community‚Äîlike my free Discord (link in my reddit profile)‚Äîto ask questions, learn from others, and gradually develop your strategy. Patience and consistency are key; trading success takes time.

In forex, I rely on price action, support and resistance levels, trend analysis, and strict risk management. Keeping emotions in check and sticking to proven strategies is crucial. I have my own way of trading markets developed over years.  
  
Silver can be a solid long-term hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. It‚Äôs more volatile than gold but has industrial uses that can drive demand, potentially making it a good investment during times of economic expansion.  
Gold is typically a stable store of value and a hedge against inflation. Over the next decade or so, it‚Äôs likely to remain a profitable investment, especially during periods of market instability or rising inflation or any geopolitical event, though prices are already inflated and for long term investment probably wait for some corrections

Comment by realtrademaster: High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms can create market noise, but they don't make it impossible for individual traders to succeed. I manage this by focusing on timeframes where HFT has less impact, like higher tf for scalping, and daily charts for swings. I prioritize key price levels, trend patterns, and market sentiment rather than competing on speed. By sticking to a well-defined strategy with clear entry and exit points, strong risk management, and avoiding emotional trading, it's possible to navigate markets effectively despite HFT activity. The key is discipline and understanding the bigger picture beyond the micro-movements.

Comment by realtrademaster: Starting with $1 in trading is challenging if not impossible due to limitations on trade size and transaction fees. It's better to focus first on learning the basics: study charts, market trends, risk management, and practice with a demo account where there's no financial risk. Once you‚Äôre comfortable, you can start small‚Äîmany brokers offer micro accounts or fractional trading options that allow you to begin with low amounts like $10-$50. The key is to treat even small amounts seriously, focus on consistency, and gradually grow your capital as you build your skills and confidence.

Not surprising - AIs replace human workers and lots of business owners did "make money with humans", i.e., hire them to do actual work. 

I already make roughly $2k/m from an AI-based side hustle but it has somehow converged. 

I'd love to explore some ideas that actually work. But more importantly, I'd love to read some actual experiences from people who use AIs in a scalable and profitable way to make money.

Comment by blasterbrewmaster: think about it this way. If you can use AI to quickly make a buck, everyone else probably has already figured that out and oversaturated the market with it. The easiest method will always be the first to become oversaturated and not worth y our time.

So what requires a little more work that these people will be too lazy to do? The two options that come to my mind are make the tools these people will pay to use (train ai models for example or build scripts that can utilize the AI for repetetive tasks), or find a way to add it to your own process that no one else has thought of that can speed up your side hustle and make you better at it. Even if AI is the main component of it, if it requires any real sembelance of work they won't touch it. Only recently learned of the "There I ruined it" guy who fakes AI covers by artists of songs they normally wouldn't sing and his process, while still AI as the main driver, is a lot more complicated than I would have expected that it makes sense why he's a cut above the rest and has a million subs.

If you want to leverage AI for a side hustle or just a regular business, think about things where a hard working, reasonably competent assistant who kind of sucks without you giving thorough direction and feedback would be especially helpful. Then use AI instead of hiring someone.

Comment by blasterbrewmaster: I think the AI voice can be done right if putting in more than bare minimum effort, which these people don't do. Probably same for the scripts if they took only the basic premise and rewrote the entire thing themselves in their own voice. More for the former though, I've started watching an Elden Ring focused channel that does AI voices based on several of the female characters and generally writes some pretty funny scripts and also does a lot of work with pitch and tone to keep the voice in character. Even seen them recently take a character that spoke with normally one accent and reworked it to talk like a pirate.

Author: sidehustle2025
Content: I've often seen it said that if you want to start a side hustle that you should scratch your own itch. If something is a problem in your life, find away to fix it and likely someone else will pay for the solution.

I did this in a roundabout sort of way.

I've done many side hustles over the years and been very successful. It's also been a ton of fun.

Friends always asked me to explain what I was doing so that they could also give it a go. I found myself explaining the same things over and over again.

It got a bit annoying, so I decided to explain everything in an ebook. Every time a friend asked, I just gave them a copy of the book.

They liked it, and many suggested I tidy it up and try selling it, so that's what I did.

It will never be life changing money and it's not intended to be. But it's a nice reward for my efforts.

It's now sold around 70 copies. That's led me to think about writing more ebooks and building up a small portfolio of them. I will release a free book this week, and a few more paid and free books over the next 6-12 months. It's really just a small experiment to see what works and what doesn't. I'll be traveling a lot over the next year, so I'll just fit in the writing whenever I can. It's not a priority for me though.

I don't need the extra income, so if it doesn't work out, that's fine.

For those that like writing, I think it's worth experimenting with ebooks. Once written, they can be a good source of passive income. It's nice to wake up to another sale. 

I'll keep you updated on this journey.

If you've tried selling ebooks, please share what worked for you.

I used Pinterest when I had a travel blog and didn't get much traction. There's a learning curve and you need to dedicate time to it to get your pins seen. I'd then also need to design pins, blah, blah, blah. I hate all that sort of stuff. This needs to be very low-key for me. If I start doing things like pinterest, it will just distract me and clutter my mind. Been there and done that. Not doing it again. Too much work for me. I want to avoid work. Also, I'm not trying to build this into a big earner. It needs to stay small. The return on my time is simply not worth the effort.

Use Google Lens to give you an idea of how much things are selling for. Download the eBay  mobile app. You will be surprised at how much some things are worth, especially old electronics that you might think have no value. Start with low value items at first until you get comfortable using  eBay, then after you make some sales move on to the higher value stuff. Look for those same items at garage sales, thrift stores on the weekend and repeat.

I can streamline mine a bit better, but getting \~8% per month. 15% margin, but takes 6-8 weeks on average for the dealership to sell them.

Comment by NoIndividual2757: If you have a phone or laptop and WiFi you can make money by creating a faceless social media account and posting 3-5 second reels advertising digital products. These are products that you purchase and then turn around and resell for 100% profit. They have master resell rights, which means once you buy a course, or product, you can resell it as is. I‚Äôve been doing it since May, in the background, and have made over 4k! That might be a good second income option for you with your down time. I do about 1-3 hours a day when I am free from the kids.

Comment by NoIndividual2757: The courses that I sell.. are courses that teach people how to become successful in digital marketing. They‚Äôre usually a series of downloadable videos that walk you through each step of how to be successful and make money using your faceless platform. The courses I sell can be resold immediately after purchase, as is. What they teach you is how to build your faceless account, how to reach your target audience, how to create content(3-5 second reels), how to set up your online store and add the courses so that they can be sold, how to close sales, and how to branch out on other platforms to make more money.

Comment by NoIndividual2757: I started by purchasing a bundle of products for under $100. It contained ten separate products that can be resold individually and added to your online store after purchase. 

The courses include an Instagram growth 101, which is a 3 hour course for growing your following and reaching your target audience, supreme digital marketing playbook, a collection of no-face reels that are readily available to use for your content, 90 days content vault, and more. 

I have this bundle in my online store. It‚Äôs called the Supreme Bundle. After I bought it, I resold it twice within the following 6 days. After that , I invested on the $500 courses with over 220 video modules because I got greedy. 

The idea of reselling a $500 course multiple times and keeping all the profit is what reeled me in to begin with. 1-2 sales of those courses a week has kept me happy. Anything more is a bonus. Considering the amount of work I put in. 

Shoot me a chat or check my Instagram (in my bio) and shoot me a DM on there if you have more questions or want to get started. üëç

A client called in stating he purchased a spell to have someone fall in love with him. Turns out, she left him, and fled the country. Since there was nothing I could due regarding a refund, as it fell under ‚Äúcustomer expectations‚Äù, they went batshit. He was saying that he‚Äôs gonna buy another spell to cast on me so I get AIDS, and my balls would fall off, and another one to have me being dragged behind a car. That was a manager escalation call for suuuuure. Later on, I was thinking that why tf would you buy another spell if the first one didn‚Äôt work? üòÇ

Content: I won‚Äôt explain my personal situation in detail, but it is such that it is impossible for me to work a traditional job any longer. I volunteer in the community, and love to do it, but I also want to be able pay my own way in the world. That said, this idea came to me and while I personally love the potential it has, I wanted to get other people‚Äôs thoughts before putting heaps of energy into it. 

The product is my attention (almost completely undivided other than probably getting up to provide door service to my dogs occasionally lol). Total non-judgement and empathy 100% guaranteed. Not in person, but via the individual‚Äôs preferred communication method. 

I would offer more than a traditional ‚Äúprofessional listener‚Äù. If they want to unload their deepest secrets and desires, cool. If they just wanna share a cup of tea and paint together, I‚Äôm all about it. A mutual craft session, yay! They wanna teach me all about their interests, they are now my interests. If they want me to pretend to be their dad while they berate me, that‚Äôd be chill. I want to offer *almost whatever* the individual feels will be most beneficial to them.

I would not offer sexual services and I would not engage in anything that causes or promotes harm.

I‚Äôm still spitballing, and the price is a big question mark. I wouldn‚Äôt really want to have set prices but rather mutually agreed on a case-by-case basis, prior to the ‚Äúsession‚Äù obviously. I need to pay the bills, but I also want to make it accessible‚Ä¶ like, I am genuinely not just aiming for a hustle I want to actually do something of value for people. I‚Äôm thinking to start at around $15 USD an hour (which would equate to around minimum wage in NZ once converted) and moving upwards from there depending on the individual‚Äôs needs and how much emotional energy was involved. I am very open to input on this, I‚Äôm not totally sure what people would be willing to pay (if anything) or what would be fair. Maybe offering chunks of time would make it more accessible? 

I would also offer almost total flexibility with regard to the most suitable timing for the individual. 

I think I would have to take payment via PayPal, if anyone has any better suggestions I'm open to them (keeping in mind I am outside of the US - New Zealand to be specific).

I am not a qualified mental health professional, I have no desire to be and the service is not intended to be a substitute for therapy where therapy would be better suited. I am just a hobbit seeking to best utilise the skills that I feel I have and make a positive contribution to the world while paying for the necessities of life.

Thanks in advance for any feedback :)

The hope would be that it would get to who it needs to get to semi-organically, that I would pick up repeat customers and the like but I realise that's not totally realistic. I would have a basic website and e-mail address... my whole philosophy is it being a real, personal service that is as close to authentic human connection as it can be when money is exchanging hands...

Content: Hi all, i have taken part in a lot of target market research for various clients, but many tools out there feel bloated and somewhat expensive so I built¬†[https://ideaclarity.co/](https://ideaclarity.co/)¬†as an MVP to test my idea.

It's a very manual process right now, and requires a lot of leg work but as a proof of concept its something i'm more than happy to do.

One of the issues i'm facing is fairly pricing the service for both parties (the participants and the buyers looking for feedback/insights)

So my question is, how much would you expect to be paid for taking part in survey (That should take no longer than 5-10 mins). Compared to a video-interview that would take 20-30 minutes?

And more importantly, is this something you would be interested in partaking in for an extra bit of cash during downtime?
Comments:
Comment by PickTour: To make some comparisons, Prolific requires at least minimum wage, but I‚Äôd say $12 - $15 per hour is about what the average survey nets.  Occasionally I‚Äôll get a $30 - $40 per hour study, but those are pretty rare.  This is just for the active time spent on the study, from acceptance to completion.

Comment by CallMeShiibbyy: Yeah i think minimum wage or higher is what I have set my initial pricing around.

For example just under $10 for a 10 minute questionnaire.

If someone could line up even 4 of those in an hour (assuming  for 5 minutes down time) they are making $40 - so a fair amount of wiggle room there. Even $5 per survey would result in $20 an hour, which seems fair?

Comment by cjy2018: You may have to weigh the sustainability of your side hustle if you're struggling. Some things to consider. 

1) Do you have to do both at the pace you are doing it now? Can you do your hustle in cycles? 

2) If you cannot do your hustle in cycles how long do you expect to do it? Is it worth just pushing hard for a couple years and extracting as much wealth as you can before stopping? 

3) If you must/want to do your side hustle consistently or have it replace full time work then you need to plan a wind down for your normal job. That might be months or years. It doesn't mean stop working but maybe looking at changing positions.

Comment by Space_Carmelo: my simple rules, hope will be inspiring for you: my side hustle is not selling stuff online, but more freelancing on projects with individual clients.

Don't work after your daily job shift, since your performance will be very likely low. During Monday-Friday, focus on your  fulltime job and if you have free time, just brainstorm and do relaxed stuff for your side hustle like organizing your tasks, write ideas and so on. Working a full day, then get home, and work again is not realistic and not effective.

have a killler documentation, Trello board or GDrive with your plans and tasks. Set realistic tasks and don't brainstorm too much!

Weekends; these are your weapons, but you have low ammo. You have 8 days per month, and at least 4 are meant to rest and to do houseworks; be realistic, don't overload.

That's ends up 4 full days per months to work with for your sidehustle clients.

Now, the winner here is: high quality clients who pay well and are good and healthy people. Close contracts and get payed for your working days and build a calendar with them.

The rest of the job is really being nice and close good relaxed contracts

Hope this helps!

Comment by Kitty_Purr_Meow: I was also going to suggest a schedule. So that way you are able to set out the time you think you have enough energy to do the side hustle tasks. Also setting a time is sort of disciplining yourself to focus on the task at hand coz that is set amount of time you have to finish that task and if you dont get it done then you are left with a backlog of work or behind on deadlines. 

Remember to also set aside time for your personal self care or things you enjoy doing to unwind in between your actual job and side hustle. The stress of jugglong both can be really stressful and daunting. 

I hope this makes sense and helps.

Content: Hello all, 30 year old toolmaker here, making 45k a year, plus i do skid steer work on the side. I‚Äôm about to sell off a piece of property and have 150-200k worth of disposable income after paying down/off my debts.

I currently don‚Äôt own a home but would love to buy one and get out if my grand parents house.

My question is, how would y‚Äôall invest that money? Go all in on skid steer work? Buy a commercial building and rent it out? Invest into a money market/hysa or cd? Start buying fixer upper houses, remolding and selling for profit? Getting off social media and ask an actual professional/cpa/financial advisor? Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you.

Comment by Troostboost: Depending on where you‚Äôre at you can probably use that money for a down payment on a duplex.

You live in 1 and rent the other 1. Your rent will offset some of your mortgage and you‚Äôll keep building equity every month. 

How old are you?

Comment by Global-Plan-8355: Assuming all of the ideas you mentioned appeal to you, I'd definitely stick it in a hysa until you figure it out.

Your first fixer-upper may be a bust as you learn, but everyone needs a place to live and the need for quality flips will never go away. Keep in mind that I (so maybe others)  would be very unlikely to buy a recently flipped house that has gray LVP, gray walls, and box store fixtures. That kind of reno speaks to me of a cheap flip and I wonder what is beneath it all every time I see one. If you buy it as a house for yourself, work on it for two years, you can sell it and take the profit or buy up, then repeat the process.

Re going all in on skid steer work, you have an opportunity to diversify here. I'd maybe take part of it and grow my business, and also invest in other ways. Just thinking of my step dad who only had his business when he retired (and 20 employees). Times were changing, equipment and ways of doing things had changed. He was lucky to sell the business at all, but he didn't get anything near what would have compensated him for his lifetime of good work.

Max out your IRA this year.

Good luck!

Comment by Troostboost: How big of a house are you looking to get. The problem is that your income isn‚Äôt that much and interest rates are stupid high. 

You could potentially look into getting something smaller and assuming a loan to keep the interest rate‚Ä¶ you have to put down a lot more than 20% as a down payment though. But on the upside your monthly mortgage payments in going to be a lot more manageable.

Content: I am a single mom who currently works 2 jobs. One of those jobs is a work from home job then my other job I work when my kids are with their dad. Dad recently completely screwed me over by taking only one of our daughters because he was mad at the other so I was forced to call out work for 2 days because I work late night shifts & she is only 12 I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving her home alone that late. I have a feeling this will become a recurring thing & sooner than later my daughter won‚Äôt be going to dads at all but I can‚Äôt afford to miss out on that money because it is essentially taking food out of my kids mouths

Are there any side hustles I can do from home or that are relatively easy I can do in case I have to quit my job..

Comment by Mindless_Window3323: It‚Äôs challenging to juggle work, parenting, and the uncertainties life throws your way. As a single mom working two jobs, the situation with your daughter‚Äôs dad must feel like a difficult obstacle. But there are home-based side hustles that can provide the flexibility and income you need.

Consider freelance writing, virtual assistance, or online tutoring‚Äîroles that can be done on your schedule and tailored around your daughter‚Äôs needs. Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr can help you get started. Additionally, selling handmade crafts or products on Etsy or eBay can offer a creative outlet while generating income.

Another avenue worth exploring is investing in an online business model. The Trend Hijacking Automation program offer the opportunity to build, launch, and scale e-commerce brands from home. This approach allows experts to guide you through creating a business designed for a profitable exit, providing you with more financial security and flexibility.

Taking control of your work-life balance through a side hustle can not only supplement your income but also offer a path to long-term stability. Remember, the goal is not just to survive but to thrive, and with the right steps, you can turn this challenge into an opportunity.

Comment by BOSH09: I've made like $14 last few days playing a Bingo game and doing a few other small challenges. Problem is it gets kinda boring and you end up running out of the free starter coins/tokens/whatever game currency it first gives you really fast. Then you're tempted to spend your money to buy more so you can keep leveling up. Well that defeats the purpose b/c you'll spend more than you'll initially make. Also I don't really like mobile games and most of the stuff on the site are mobile games. I'm almost level 60 in the Bingo game but it's taking forever to level enough to make money. Anyway, if you have nothing better to do and want to push a button on your phone or play cartoon-y bingo, go nuts, but if you want to actually make cash, ehhhh I don't think the $100 is worth the many many hours/days/weeks it'll take ya know.

Have you reached out to shopify? Their support team is very helpful. I used to work there.
Also helpful for basic set up stuff is their help centre.

Author: Nectarch
Content: Preface:
Looking around at the adults in my life, I‚Äôve noticed they have far less free time than I do‚Äîmostly consumed by work and responsibilities. I‚Äôve been told that after high school and college, this kind of free time will be rare. So, while I have it, I want to do something meaningful.

Income Sources:
1. YouTube Channel: I earn $5-$7 daily on average.
   - Details: I post twice a day, with each video taking around 30 minutes to create. It‚Äôs not a huge time commitment. I use my parents' bank details with their permission, and they‚Äôre fully supportive.

2. Allowance: I receive about $2 per day.
   - Details: Self-explanatory.

Savings:
- Total Savings: $2,100 in cash, stored securely. I also budget and track my expenses regularly.

Skills:
- Guitar: I‚Äôm one of the top five fingerstyle guitarists at my school.
- Coding: I‚Äôm proficient in both C++ and Python.
- English: While not my first language, I‚Äôm fluent and nearing native speaker proficiency.
- Tech Savvy: I once made about $30 selling pirated games and software to friends‚Äîeasy money, though not a long-term strategy.

Social Media:
I manage multiple profiles with specific focuses:
- School-Related Content
- Personal Growth & Self-Improvement
- Random Personal Stuff

This keeps me organized and focused on what matters most. 

Books (Read & To-Read):
Completed:
  - 100M Offers 
  - Psychology of Money
Currently Reading:
  - 100M Leads
Next Up:

Background:
I was born into an upper-middle-class family in a developing country. I recognize the luck I‚Äôve had and intend to maximize my potential. I‚Äôm driven by ambition and have the time and freedom to make the most of it.

Key Glock - Ambition for Cash
‚ÄúI got a real ambition for this cash (yeah)‚Äù
‚ÄúThirteen years old, with a shoebox stash (yeah)‚Äù
‚ÄúI'm always up to somethin', never sittin' on my ass‚Äù

Time and freedom are my greatest assets, and I‚Äôm determined not to waste them. What more can i do?

Comment by BullfrogOk1977: When you say meaningful, I'm going to assume you mean money making meaningful given this is r/sidehustle. Here's what I'd suggest: 

Start some kind of low cost, low risk business. Mow lawns. Pressure wash garbage bins. Or create simple things you think you can monetize with your tech skills. Start using your free time to learn about business fundamentals and try them out with your low cost, low risk business venture. Invest any money you make and consider what aspects of your experience you like and which you don't, to inform what you might want to do for the future. 

But also: go to movies, parks, and the beach. You're only 16 once. And on the chance you mean 'meaningful' in a non-monetary sense, look to volunteer opportunities with those most struggling in your local society. If it's a nice place to live, help keep it that way for everyone who lives there.

Comment by Crow_of_Judgment_: I would try to buy one bond and one etf time to time, like 4 times a year so that you learn how it works and see how your money will grow in time. These two things are the essentials to investing and require very little to understand. Once you read a bit about them and watch a few yt videos you are ready to go. No need to invest a lot. Just a bit since you have more important expenses now, like being a kid and having fun :)

Comment by BullfrogOk1977: Part of being a good business leader is balancing ambition with having a positive standing in the society they operate in. As well as learning to discover unmet needs in that society that they can meet. Customers leave businesses over bad service, and learning to exercise empathy is part of learning to provide good service. This teen seems interested in learning all aspects of business, which includes that part. Most teens aren't reading business books, but this one is.

Sex advice I hope they get from someplace other than Reddit and really has no relevance to their question.

Comment by Verryfastdoggo: Try local lead gen. Build a website or landing page and either do SEO or Google ads to generate some leads and then find a business owner willing to pay for them. Some call it rank and rent but you really don‚Äôt even need to rank it if you can set up a halfway decent ad. 

Especially if you find really high ticket services. Most business owners will happily do 10% commission if they close, it‚Äôs free money to them. 

Been doing this for a while now and I‚Äôll always suggest it. Plenty of niches out there totally untapped potential. Best side hustle ever, actually turned from my side to my full time hustle.

Comment by AOCsMommyMilkers: I used to do fiberglass repair for a boat manufacturer. After a few years of learning layup and finish work, I began advertising at my local marinas for gelcoat repairs. It got to where I had to hire on the guy who taught me to do the work as help. I made the mistake of letting him collect the deposit for a big job. He took off with it, and I barely had enough money to finish the work I had lined up and word got around about the issue with the deposit and I lost customers and couldn't build my name back up. I went from refusing jobs at $250+ an hour labor rate because i was so busy, to losing everything in a month because I trusted the wrong person. So, my advice is to never put yourself in the same position I was in. Never let an employee handle more money, then you can comfortably afford to lose and float until things are good again. Like they say, a reputation that takes years to build takes seconds to destroy.

Comment by sdday81: I create and sell digital products. Think ebooks, guides and courses. Its is my full time income cause I didn‚Äôt have any other options. I lost my job of 13 years in January and spent months searching with no luck. So in April I invested in learning about ways to make money online and learned about digital products and went all in. 

Since I was out of work I gave it all of my attention. Was slow at first, as I was learning and experimenting. Took 45 days to make my first sale. But after that sale was under my belt, I began to expand beyond IG, which is where I started. I went into Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest and Threads. Learned how to market products there.

Threads has been a really great place to make sales. I‚Äôve found it very easy to create viral content that brings me customers. Had a thread yesterday which hit 70k views. Which is big for threads.

Just added TikTok. But I‚Äôve now gone beyond digital products and have small businesses reach out to me to help them setup storefronts, create digital products for their followers/communities and help them with branding.

I‚Äôve reached a point where I was able to just stop looking for work. But I went all in 100% due to being out of a job. You can still do it, while you have a job and I highly recommend that way, lol. It‚Äôs hard doing it from the bottom.

Managed to complete the repairs for the customers as promised? I don't see why a customer would leave because you had a bad employee, that's obviously now gone, if anything I think they'd feel a little sympathetic and would try to send you more work? Or are you leaving off the part where you never completed the work promised, because it's your business and whether your
employee ran off with a deposit or not, it's still your liability to complete the repairs as promised. You deal with your employee and the money situation behind the scenes. At the end of the day it's up to you and only you to make sure your business and reputation is upheld. If you didn't follow thru with the work, it's your fault you lost the business.

Starting today I'm boarding a guinea pig for 10 days so that's $100. Next week I'm boarding a small dog for 5 days ($200). It varies from week to week but it is growing quickly.

Comment by Hezers: I wait until I get contacted by my contacts. So essentially I built my business through reputation. When I get called to lend a hand and it‚Äôs hourly, I charge $40 an hour then when I get contacted about an entire job removing it‚Äôs paid per square foot. 95 percent of the time I am working per square foot removing flooring and those jobs are usually given to my directly through salesman at the flooring company‚Äôs so it lines up . I remove floor- installer goes in right after me. Work is split by me getting paid to remove, installer getting paid to install. The installer always gets the opportunity to remove themself but almost all of them prefer me to do it

I also have helped install flooring a few times with Installers through my hourly charge

Comment by moffman93: I can't stress this enough, but whatever you wind up doing for extra money, downplay how much money you're making to your parents and save it, because there's a chance they might expect you to start paying for everything yourself and you're just a kid.

i would print out flyers that advertised my services and go door to door asking my neighbors if they needed anything

I wish I could tell you a great way to make money online, but what are you good at?

When I was your age I was mowing lawns, selling candy at school,  raking leaves, shoveling driveways when it snowed, laying mulch that the owner would buy, cleaning garbage cans, and helping clean out garages and basements for elderly neighbors. I collected cans and bottles to return for the deposit as well.

Comment by Antique-Elephant-519: I made money at that age baby sitting my friends younger brothers and shoveling horse stalls to pay for my riding lessons. In Pennsylvania I believe you have to be 15 to work an actual job at a legitimate business and be on the payroll with parents permission. If you are an animal lover, local farmers/horse people will be very likely to pay you a little bit to help them. They always need help. 

All the other suggestions are wonderful too, but farms need the same jobs done every day and the work will always be there. This also will teach you very valuable life skills, and responsibilities, and the circle of life. You will have a better understanding of how life works than your peers who don‚Äôt have that experience. 

Snow comes less and less each year. I see signs everywhere for mowing crews and power washers. 

Also agree with the people saying you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for your parents expenses, take the money you make and pay for your own stuff, like your phone and school clothes maybe food and some fun times with friends. but definitely save some of that money. In 3 years you could definitely save enough to buy yourself a car when you turn 16.

Pet sitting or walking can be a great first job. You can make slime and sell it online or locally, or you can make other crafts. If you‚Äôre talented with digital art, you can sell templates through Etsy. Just please only work with trusted adults and stay safe‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

Comment by Dragon_YanA: If your parents have a car, maybe they could help you pick up used furniture from facebook marketplace for $20-$50 (sometimes for free) from people moving out or college students getting rid of furniture at the end of the semester and you can resell them for a higher price. I did this as a side hustle in 2020 during the pandemic and made close to $1k in 3 months. It‚Äôs not a lot of money but I wasn‚Äôt doing physical work for hours to earn it. A lot of the times it just was a 5min detour from work or grocery store. 

I‚Äôve seen teenagers posting on the app NextDoor offering services like cutting the grass, raking leaves, washing cars, pet sitting, shoveling snow etc. You can also knock door to door in the neighborhood and ask if anyone wants to give you some cash for some chores around the house. If someone from my neighborhood offers to do dishes, laundry, clean the house, bathroom etc, as a busy full time mom who works from home I would be happy to $8-10 an hr cash.

Comment by Left-Clue2734: My kids do user interviews. There are several for kids that use social media..tiktok, threads ect. My son has spoken with people about movies they were making, deodorant use, mental health and more. Your mom or dad need to sign up, but you can use your email so you can manage it. When you see one that fits you or them, have them do their portion and you complete yours. Sometimes you get selected sometimes not. It is not consistent work but my son has earned over $1000 in two years and he loves it. He uses it to get xbox gift cards but they have most restaurants and stores as well as visa cards. I do it too but it's up to your parents if they would like to talk to someone for an hour for $75 or not. Sometimes more or less money, but I feel my time is worth $75 per hour...typical rate. But I've gotten a $325 to do a  video food journal in June. I think that was my highest. My son is in one now that pays up to $85 a month. $10 guaranteed.

Otherwise the usual paper route or mow lawns; people actually can turn that latter one into a legit business they carry on to owning & growing it into making a serious career out of later in life. Or could learn to screen print like printing tshirts etc if can raise the capital upfront to start a business like that‚Ä¶or there‚Äôs tons of opportunities online now that don‚Äôt require the same amount of upfront capital. Either way best of luck dude, I can appreciate your situation and all that you‚Äôre doing to try and help but like another person said be sure to protect yourself‚Ä¶money sometimes makes people weird and can bring out the worse, especially when it‚Äôs desperately needed

Comment by Bersabrie: I had a little hustle in middle school and high school where I bought a 101 piece candy straws bag from the dollar store (pixie sticks, which you could get for $1) and I sold them for 10 cents each which turned into $10 a bag in profit.


¬†Then I'd just add supply from other candies, like Reese's cups and Kitkats. I'd buy the 10 packs for about $2 each at the dollar store from the profit with the pixie sticks. (Fun sized, sold for 25 cents each.)¬†¬†


Made some fairly decent money for it being the late 90s, early 2000s but I didn't do it to make money for myself. I used the funds to buy Christmas presents for the runaway girls at the halfway house.¬†


If I remember correctly, it was about $40-$80 a month. You could make more in theory but because of a little debacle in 9th grade (I tried to "hire" someone to help me and they wanted all the profit so they ratted me out), the code of conduct changed to where students couldn't sell candy or they'd be suspended in my high school.¬†

Comment by BPTPB2020: Don't feed people's addictions like that. People OD on that shit and it ruins lives. Even yours if they decide to try you as an adult if someone dies and it comes back to you.


Don't make other people's lives shittier just to make yours better. Karma will come and bite your ass off and you'll deserve it.¬†


If you're going the route of drugs, at least stick to the fun and safer ones. It's easy to grow shrooms, it's easy to extract DMT. But I would recommend neither to a 13 year old in any serious capacity. The better option is literally anything else.¬†


Go do surveys, mow lawns, walk dogs, fix things for people. Go on Fivver and see if there's anything up your alley.¬†

I would recommend meeting up during the day when there‚Äôs traffic on the road, and if I‚Äôm selling, I always met at a public place (grocery store parking lot, nearby hospital, gas station etc). I tend to buy and sell one large furniture at a time so I kept it in the car without the need to moving and storing it - this way the buyer didn‚Äôt have to come to my house to buy it.

I would NEVER touch that shit now. I'm fine with my shrooms though. No ODing with those, at least not lethally.

Content: 
I‚Äôm an electronics technician with 1.5 years of experience in repairing a variety of devices, especially gaming consoles and phones. I‚Äôve been passionate about electronics repair since high school, and I‚Äôve even turned it into a profitable side hustle, earning around $1,000 a month by buying, fixing, and selling broken consoles. All while studying and working a part time job at a restaurant. I have since abandoned my job at the restaurant and work at a phone repair shop.

Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking about taking this  hobby in a new direction by starting a mobile repair service. The idea is to operate out of a van, driving to people‚Äôs homes to repair their phones, consoles, and other electronics right at their doorstep.

I can already see some benefits and downsides of operating inside a van. On the plus side, I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay rent, which I think would save me a lot of money. However, a downside is that I won‚Äôt have a permanent space for people to easily remember or recognize my business. I could potentially counter this by offering cheaper, yet still profitable, prices to incentivize people to call me for repairs.

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîhas anyone here tried something similar, or do you have thoughts on how profitable this could be?

Comment by joyfuljake2: I have done mobile repair before, and I think I can offer some of my insight which will help you in your decision-making process here. By trade, I'm a musical instrument repair technician and luthier (for those who don't know, a luthier is a craftsman and repairman of stringed instruments). For a little over three years I did exclusively mobile instrument repairs. My repair vehicle was my office, and I would travel to all of my appointments on a dedicated route. This included elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as colleges and universities. I would also offer my services for band and drum corps competitions doing emergency repairs on-site. Every once in a while, I would have individual clients contact me and I would meet them either at their residence or in a parking lot and I would repair their instruments that way. 

In many instances, it was a fine model to have. Band directors knew that I would be coming by on a particular day of the week and they would set aside the instruments that were in need of fixing in anticipation of my arrival. If there were emergencies, they could call me and I would do my best to make it out to them same day or next day. 

As the previous commenter said, wrapping your vehicle with your branding and contact information is a great way to have a mobile billboard that advertises your services everywhere you go and wherever you are parked. 

Now there ARE some difficulties with mobile repairs as a business model that made me decide it wasn't worth it FOR ME. Your mileage may vary. 

The first and most annoying to me as the technician was that not all repairs are created equal, and they often take longer than what a book rate would say. With instruments as well as electronics, diagnosis can eat up a large chunk of time. You might spend an hour on a console where 50 minutes was spent searching for the problem, and 10 minutes was spent replacing a singular capacitor. And you might get into the weeds of a problematic repair and realize that instead of a simple reflow of a CPU to fix a red ring of death, you also have to do a bunch of repairs to a DVD drive or a power supply. Working with these kinds of time-sucks can be a real challenge if you are in a mobile repair capacity and promising same-day service. A fix for this could be that you have a system in place where the client agrees to let you take the broken item to your home workshop to more extensively repair it, but before you know it, you could have a large backlog of clients that are waiting to be taken care of.  

Another annoying part of the mobile repair model is the availability of parts. What if you are on-site and you realize that you don't have a component you need to complete the repair? Which gets back into taking repairs with you to tackle later. Do you leave the client with their still broken item while you wait for a shipment from Digi-Key? Do you bring it home with you and leave the client a repair ticket? Long gone are the days where you could drive to your local Radio Shack and find the caps, fets, resistors, and ICs you need for a repair. Stocking every part you may need on the road can be difficult when so many consoles, phones, and other electronics use such a vast variety of parts. 

  
It's also difficult to have a junk pile on the road with you. I know with musical instrument repair, I have gone digging into my junk pile on countless occasions to snag parts for a repair of a client's instrument. 

  
You will also want to make sure you are logging your mileage, as it can be easy to rack up a ton of miles for a $30 job that puts you in the red. 

  
Also, you need to make sure you keep up with your vehicle maintenance more than any other vehicle you have ever driven. Since it's your office, if you break down and need a tow or your vehicle is in the shop for a few days, those lost days are lost income. And they are lost income that is still costing you money since you will have a vehicle repair bill to handle after the vehicle is back on the road. 

  
I don't want to scare you out of this, as I like the idea. But I do want you to be made aware of a few of the trials and tribulations that I went through when I was doing mobile repairs.

Find out where there's a local dump or recycling center. 
Maybe gravel or mulch delivery, but most might rent the truck from the Box Store unless you will lay it down too. Get a trailer after a short while and you can haul more. 

Be willing to tow some trailers for other people, sometimes people buy things like small boats or jet skis and don't realize their car can't pull them safely.

Content: Long story short, my parents (early 70s) did not plan well for retirement. My mom still works as a clerk at an elementary school but, as one would imagine, it doesn't pay well. Otherwise, they are living on SS. They are making ends meet but my dad has fallen in bad health over the last two years and has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Their mortgage is $800 a month---which is probably less than they could rent for---and they are happy there. My fear is that Dad will eventually need more care during the day which will prohibit her from working a full school day. Then, when he passes, she will lose her SS payment (as his is the higher of the two). If she can pay the mortgage, which amounts to roughly $25 a day, they can make this work with help from my sister and I. Any ideas?
Comments:
Comment by cubbiefan803: Can a family member move in to help care for them?  My wife and I (once our son went off to college) sold our house and moved in with my folks.  We did this for 2 reasons.  1 being that the area we were living in was starting to get run down and we wanted out. The other being that my folks are getting older and my dad still works 2 days at Menards to help make ends meet.  Currently they are 82 and 75.  My dad ended up almost dying from COVID within the first month we moved and fought his way back and is doing well.  However, I can tell that it is taking a toll on him working those 2 days a week.  They are in the same boat as your folks, they did a terrible job planning for retirement. My dad gets his railroad pension and SS and my mom gets a little (she was a stay at home mom most of the time).  Long story short, with us moving in it has allowed them to be a little less stressed over finances, they now have live in care and my dad only continues to work so that they can have some fun money (casino, etc). I hope you are able to find a solution.  Watching our parents get older is no fun.  My mom is starting to show signs of dementia or Alzheimer's.  It's not easy to watch or go thru.  I wish you the best of luck and sending a virtual hug.

Content: I just had this idea pop into my head. I have seen videos before where people clean out dryer vents. So I started doing some research and looking into what would be needed for the job. From what I can tell, I would need the dryer vent cleaning snake, a drill, a vacuum, and some personal protection equipment such as a mask and gloves. I think a bonus would be a snake camera to inspect the vents afterwards. Or the inspection could be a consultation with a minimum fee, and if the customer decides they don‚Äôt want/need the service that‚Äôs up to them. 

From what I can tell from some Googling, the rates per location are around $100-300 depending on the length of the ventilation system. 

It seems that it would be fairly easy to market this service as it can cause an actual fire hazard if left untreated. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs any kind of licensing I would need in order to get into this? Thanks!
Comments:
Comment by Sundial1k: I would call my city, and my state regarding licensing, you also may need to be bonded.  And don't forget liability insurance, just in case something goes wrong; and a contract drawn up that can be tailored to use with each client.

I would also think about a camera that could look in the duct work/vents which might be useful on the more complicated systems; like two or three story homes...

Comment by LowSkyOrbit: Get your business license and some liability insurance for the work. LLC for the company that has it's own bank account and set yourself up to be paid by the LLC.

Offer up services on local groups, door hangers,  and try your best to do weekend door to door sales. Just have a flyer with set prices for cleanings or hose replacements (a good upsell). Price yourself around $150 a cleaning and another $100 if they go full replacement. Ask if they would want a yearly service to be done and lock in your price as a guarantee for the next 3-5 years.  Use a real estate app to find expensive neighborhoods and target them first.

Yes, it's technically using someone's work. In order to avoid copyright you need to add additional content to the video. This is why you see videos with games on top or bottom, some kind of craft, ect every now and again.

 The reason why the big streamers/content creators don't mind is because it shows their content to more people. It's only when the content goes against/damages their brand it's an issue.

Comment by BrowntownJ: Go to school, get a part time job learning valuable skills like sales and customer service.

Seriously kid, I mean this in the best possible way:

YOU DONT NEED A SIDE HUSTLE.

You need skills. You need to learn how the world works, you need to experience failure and life.

You live in a bubble, you have no clue how anything works at all. 

A side hustle requires direction, self control, discipline, and a decent understanding of how to trade services and products for monetary compensation. 

You have no experience or value to provide right now (I know that sounds so incredibly mean and I‚Äôm so sorry it comes across that way) and that‚Äôs totally okay.

You‚Äôre a kid. You‚Äôre supposed to know kid things. Be a kid. 

Some of us never got a chance, you have internet and a phone when I had a drunk step dad and a black eye. 

Just enjoy your life, learn some skills, get a summer or part time job if you really want money. Learn how to sell, learn how to manage inventory, learn how to lead people. All of these things are important life skills and any retail/customer service job will give you the basics AND the bonus is they will make you understand customer behaviour (People suck in my opinion) 

Please OP, stop watching hustle culture on YouTube and TikTok. Your friends are morons and they‚Äôre supposed to be, the smartest ones are the ones who are focusing on enjoying the things they have before they have to be responsible and contribute to society

While I mean what I said above, and that comes first, teach yourself video editing. Make cool edits of your favorite things - superheroes, football/soccer, movies etc. Do it for fun. Or learn a craft, solely for fun, like drawing or 3D modelling. Read a ton of books, for fun. Maybe try to write some of your own like a short story. When you're older and wiser and struggling for money, maybe that can come in handy.

Comment by BrowntownJ: Yes there‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt allow children to get jobs. 

That was the whole point of my post, is there is always the ‚Äúteen friendly part time‚Äù jobs like babysitting, paper delivery, or some retail shops have options for younger teens and there are laws around what is and isn‚Äôt allowed. 

Op is a child, we do not use children for labour. 

A side hustle is for someone who is either:

1) Trying to be an Entrepreneur 
 

Or 

2) Make financial choices sacrificing a portion of their life to make sure that their adult responsibilities are taken care of. 


OP is neither of these people because there are adults that should be taking care of OP, and who it sounds like are considering they have a laptop, a phone and are looking to make ‚Äúextra‚Äù income which sounds like OP is thinking about the future and was raised well with loving parents. 

My advice is that enjoying this time is more important than ‚Äúcapitalizing‚Äù on it to make $$. I get that the world is in a TOUGH economic place but that is an adult problem for actual adults. OP is wise beyond their years and we need to remember to protect our children from bearing the responsibility without overprotecting for not understanding.

My first thought is to buy a multi unit building, basically as many units as I can get financed, and so long as it cash flows, let it appreciate over time.

Wondering if that‚Äôs a decent move and how you‚Äôd go about financing it. Traditional mortgage, seller finance, hard money loan, or something more creative.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If you‚Äôve tried this before, what advice can you give based on challenges you‚Äôve encountered? Would a single family home be a better idea?

Comment by TitleAffectionate193: I do this, it‚Äôs not as difficult as people make it out to be as long as you handle it correctly. Depending on how many units, you may need a commercial loan that balloons every 5 or so years. I like the 2-4 unit range and it works well in my area. 

Just make sure the location is nice, finishes are nice, and screen your tenants correctly. Have handymen on call if something comes up and don‚Äôt neglect your properties. I have a W2 and manage my rentals on my own, it takes a few hours a month.

Also make sure to have a plan to cover unexpected expenses. Happy to answer any specific questions.

You also benefit from depreciation on the asset, which stocks don‚Äôt do. And you can find ways to do it with little or no money out of your own pocket, but that takes good relationships with $$ partners.

Comment by The_Admiral_Blaze: If you‚Äôve got the capital the easiest way to go is with DSCR loans, they only go buy the potential rental income of the property and don‚Äôt care what your finances are as long as you have the down payment and typically you need 20%. That‚Äôs the easiest way to buy multi unit homes or buildings but it could take a lot of capital.

Personally I like buying barely habitable multi unit properties on a hard money loan, fixing them up and renting them out and then using a DSCR loan to refinance out of the hard money loan. You have experience flipping so this could be easy for you. You end up with equity and since you only need a loan to cover the hard money then you gain equity. You can either use the DSCR loan to get cash back or only get the amount needed to cover the hard money loan and have a lower monthly payment and cash flow more off the rent.

Comment by BornFeeling1471: So as answered multiple times already by other respondents, real estate is not passive. It can be minimal once you've found the property and have got it in the condition you want with good tenants.

I'd suggest starting small with a low end single family home and trying it on for size before scaling up to multi family units. And it's a lot less stressful to manage a lived in home with a couple dents and dings than one in immaculate condition. I'm not saying buy a hole and be a slum landlord, but get it in your head that you're renting a product that can't ever be perfect, and dealing with patching a wall will be a lot easier. Stuff breaks sometimes.

Now about your tenants? Couple things there. Once you find good tenants (which might very well take a while,) you take care of them. You call periodically to see how things are going, you show up with cookies the wife baked for Christmas. You don't jack the rent 400 dollars because you resigned your mortgage and the payment went up 50 bucks. You're offering a place to be someone's home, and the bar is pretty low these days to be a good landlord.

Now the other side of the coin. You've heard it already here. People complain that they can't buy a home because of real estate investment. Now some of these people are right, they're getting priced out of the market, but I'll relay a conversation I had about money with my tenant over a beer after fixing the AC. He was saying he liked the house but was also hoping to invest in his own home some day. I told him he could definitely afford this house because he was already paying for it, and that we could definitely talk about it if that was something he wanted. He immediately disagreed because he wouldn't be able to afford it if something went wrong. the rent he's paying covers all the maintenance on that house plus a bit left over for me, but he had a complete disconnect over it. He's a smart man  with a huge blind spot, and he'll probably rent his entire life because of a perceived future cost he's already paying for now. Being able to supply a decent product at a reasonable price to a person like this doesn't make you POS like some have said. A lot of people rent their entire lives because they have this blind spot.

Comment by BIGA670: If you‚Äôre going to do it, you need to sit down and calculate the return on investment including every expense, variable, unforeseen circumstance, opportunity cost, etc. 

Most don‚Äôt factor things like vacancy, tenant non payment/turnover/eviction/damages, maintenance and repair, taxes, insurance, interest, hoa, property management fees etc. into their equations.

Everything looks good on paper when they go according to plan, except that things never go according to plan especially when dealing with multiple tenants.  It‚Äôs also important you do it under the correct business entity to protect yourself from lawsuits.

It‚Äôs anything but a passive investment, even if you have a property management company (which takes 8-10% off the top btw) because the second a water heater breaks or a tenant is late on payment, they will be calling you asking how you want to handle it.

I looked into buying a bunch of units overseas, but after running the analysis realized I could make more in a truly passive investment like money market mutual funds or index funds.

Comment by catdog1111111: If you can get a good deal and get something below market value. Real estate prices have gone thru the roof in the past three years. And in those years there is a cultural shift towards squatting and cities shafting the owners. The cities are run by developers flooding the market with housing in spite of parking requirements, traffic, and resources. The real estate is going to adjust due to the prices and damaged standard of living. If you can get a good deal you may be in the black, but it it‚Äôs a lot of work and often slim margins between rent vs actual costs.¬†

Adding additional funds to your investment, and giving you an easy exit at an already acceptable gain. 

Real estate has leverage that allows your gains to exceed your investment, along with appreciation. 

For example 50k is 20% of 250k which you control for only 50k. 10% of 250k is 25k which after closing expenses, and hiring a numbskull to show you where to sign your name. Is a pretty good deal on top of your initial investment of 50k. 

Then add rents, and you‚Äôre out of pocket even less for your debt service. It‚Äôs a pretty great deal, especially because you can roll your gains into another property tax free. 

It‚Äôs such a good deal, entry into the market has gotten cost prohibitive for entire generations. Because they simply can‚Äôt make enough to save enough to afford it in the first place.

Comment by TheRealLRonHoyabembe: So unless you slumlord it you‚Äôre not gonna make a lot of extra money month to month. MDUs don‚Äôt typically appreciate at the same rate as a single family home. 

For the best ROI, purchase single family homes with enough down that you can net an extra $500/month. Put that money to the side because you‚Äôre gonna use it for maintenance/repairs in between tenants. 

For the best month to month income, buy a 4-plex in the hood and provide the minimum legal upkeep and conditions. Your karma will go to shit but you‚Äôll make a lot of money.

Comment by MHHIR: This is some great real advice. I do have some experience flipping. I‚Äôve done it three times now. Never with the intent to get rich, more of a buy what I could afford, fix it up and sell to cover my next down payment.

I would never become a landlord on a get rich quick scheme. The goal would be to provide an adequate living space for someone at a reasonable rate and know that it‚Äôll pay off in 15+ years.

My head always goes, why buy a Single family home when I could buy a 4 unit, or why buy a 4 unit when I could buy a collection of 4 units. I‚Äôll need to gain some perspective and some patience.

Thank you for this.

Comment by Individual-Fan-6138: I have a few people I know who make a lot of money in real estate and each of them have told me the same thing when I ask about investing in real estate‚Ä¶ they always tell me to just find houses with instant equity if possible and utilize the positive equity to secure a loan to help fund flipping the house to sale. Making profit off rentals is a numbers game since the margins are low unless the home is paid off and comes with loads of headaches and expenses after tenants move out.

USDA loans are great but they‚Äôre for primary residences, have income caps, and also require time at the job. Which for me personally is difficult because I work on a contract basis under a w2.

An ex girlfriend of mine bought her house with a usda loan, refinanced it after several years, paid off all her debt and now has a lump of cash along with a rental property.

Comment by Individual-Fan-6138: So I‚Äôm not the expert on this, just repeating how it was explained to me since my brother in law currently does this. He seaks out houses that has instant equity, say a house worth $150k that he can get for $120k because it has a lot of issues but it still has value. He gets a loan on the $120k for the house with now $30k in positive equity. He has two options‚Ä¶. Use the $30k in equity for a loan to immediately begin renovations OR if he has another hot deal lined up with instant equity he can use his current equity as a down payment for the new property without coming out of pocket much if any at all. But the ultimate goal is to flip as quick as possible and repeat. He‚Äôs not trying to turn these into dream homes, just make them up to code and livable with a few cosmetic touches to increase the value more and sale for a profit. 

But he consistently says he doesn‚Äôt care about interest so much in the current market because he rarely holds a house for more than 6 months before selling and always preaches on avoiding using your own money at all costs.

Also he preaches to get you a banker and use that same banker over and over again. So long as they are making money and happy, you will get better loans and be happy.

Comment by Individual-Fan-6138: Haha yeah‚Ä¶ if you want to flip as a side gig you basically have to hire a GC to flip it for you or find the subcontractors yourself. And like you, I don‚Äôt feel like chasing down rent payments plus I‚Äôve witnessed how much damage a lot of tenants can cause in just a year and let‚Äôs say that one month security deposit doesn‚Äôt always cover it.

I‚Äôd maybe start with just one small cheap house that you could spend a year renovating to get your feet wet that won‚Äôt break the bank and see if the profit you make from it was worth the time your money was tied up and the effort you put into it.

Another option is find someone who already routinely flips houses and has been successful and be an investor with them. Share a percentage of the costs for a percentage of the profit margin. Investors OPM (other people‚Äôs money) and it could be a way to get your feet wet, just make sure to have a contract in place.

Comment by OPQstreet: Don't give up. Also, it's starting to become more second-job than side-hustle, but writing a blog or starting a YouTube channel about that task with sincere information and current events on that topic can help drive customers to you, whether privately or on Fiverr. It will take time, though. Don't sell out to get more people to see it; just make it high quality so people will return.

Comment by NoIndividual2757: I have a handful in my store. 

Every course is basically an instructional guide /strategies that teach you how to become successful in digital marketing and reselling MRR courses (courses that come with master resell rights, meaning once you buy the course you own the rights and can resell for 100% profit).

The specific courses I sell are the Ultimate Branding Course (220+ video modules that cover every aspect of being a digital entrepreneur), and Roadmap Exclusive. These are considered big ticket courses because they are around $500. Every time you sell, it‚Äôs $500 to you. 

Other courses I sell are smaller and cheaper, like the viral insta growth 101 mini course (3 hours of video ) which shows you how to build your social media to get engagement, followers, and increased views. 

I also sell a bundle , which includes 10 digital products which can all be sold separately in your online store after purchase. This covers all the bases for being successful digital marketing. This is really popular because you buy one package and can resell and price all of the 10 courses/products individually , and set you own prices. No limit to how much it can be sold. 

I also have some free guides for those that want to learn more about getting started. And a free 90 content vault for once people do get started. 

Ok I‚Äôve said A LOT here. lol

Comment by NoIndividual2757: I actually have two accounts. One with nearly 2,500 followers and one with 74 followers. Both of them I started with zero followers in late May. I‚Äôve made several sales on my account with 74 followers. 

You‚Äôre probably not interested, but I can also show you that the account with 74 followers has posts that have reached over 40k people. If your content reaches people, you make sales. 

It actually doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a following or not, it matters if your content is getting pushed correctly through the algorithm to reach the right people. 

Having a decent following does tend to show some level of credibility to a potential consumer, though. So you are right thereüëç


But it surprisingly doesn‚Äôt prevent people from making sales. 

If no one with under 1,000 followers was able to make any money, for example, I don‚Äôt think a lot of people would try this or stick around like they do. 

I do see what you are saying though. The courses explicitly teach you how to grow your account quickly, for brand awareness etc. 

The reality is.. you could make sales on day one or day 20. You will still need to develop and grow your account. 

Wow , I didn‚Äôt intent for this post to be so long lolll

Comment by subsetsum: Agreed. Unless you already have a large social media following that wants this stuff after being burned out on all the MLM pitches. I personally don't want any of these things but I'm probably not your target audience. First figure out who you will market to. Busy moms? Teens? Then what are their pain points? What would solve a problem or bring them joy that they can't get elsewhere or easily? Roll on perfume, you'll have to worry about allergic reactions and storing it safely until you sell it. You might not even be allowed to sell it. There's likely tons of ideas on Etsy that you can look though to see what's popular.

Comment by IWantALargeFarva: Babysitting was my go-to as a kid. If you're in the northern hemisphere,  summer is ending, so your opportunity for full-time hours are just coming to an end for a season. Take the Red Cross babysitting course. You can even take it online. Become CPR certified. Then go to Canva and make a graphic to advertise your services. Go to your local Facebook groups. Search for "Anytown Happenings," "Moms of Anytown," things like that. Don't spam them. See if there's a certain day they allow small business posts. Use proper grammar. And let them know you're certified and looking for business. 

Offer date night babysitting, weekend babysitting. But also offer babysitting during school breaks or half days. This is huge. Parents normally don't have off work on those days.

Before summer starts, see if you can find a family with 2 kids who is looking for full-time care in their home. It's fun to play with the kids all summer, and it's great money for you. Tip: if one of their parents works for a college, they might have summer hours, meaning they only work 4 days a week. That would give you a 3 day weekend!

Comment by Silly_Run_3398: Yes, the flowy garden style has been trending the past decade or so. I love it too! I purchase flowers from places like Mayesh or the LA flower district. It's flowers sold in bulk from farms. Most commercially grown flowers come from California, Ecuador, and Holland. Not necessarily from someones greenhouse, though you could shop local flower farms if you happen to live in an area with lots of those.

 But you do get wholesale pricing usually with the proper paperwork. Some wholesalers don't sell to anyone without at least a seller's permit. Most farmers markets require you to grow your own flowers. I don't have the space to grow my own. One day maybe ü§ûüèª. I currently work in a brick and mortar store. But I operate my event florals out of my house.

Content: Hey fellow Sidehustlers! üëã 

I wanted to share a story that proves sometimes the best ideas come from unexpected places and connections.

My name is Ahaan and I have been trying to build a profitable microsaas since the starting of this year. 

I built one with another friend of mine in March 2024 and it has been doing well. It aint making crazy money, but it is something!

I see a lot of folks lurking around and i read all the comments. I lurk around here too! I wanted to share a small story about building my second product, read on. 

Pramod and I have known each other since last year, thanks to Twitter. We've been following each other's journey in the indie maker space, sharing insights and cheering each other on from afar. Pramod's story has been particularly inspiring - he's been indie hacking for the past year, successfully launching and selling multiple side projects. His most notable success has been Motionshot, which has gained significant traction in the indie community.

Before diving into the indie world full-time, Pramod was a tech lead at a startup in India. His transition from a secure job to the unpredictable yet exciting world of indie hacking is a testament to his passion and skill - something that resonated with me as I embarked on my own indie journey.

In March 2024, I launched my first indie project, Notsly. It was an exhilarating experience, full of learnings and challenges. As I navigated the world of user acquisition and growth, I found myself wishing for better tools to leverage my existing user base.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when Pramod mentioned he was traveling to Kuala Lumpur(I'm based out of KL). He reached out to me for some local advice - where to stay, best places to eat, you know the drill. Naturally, I suggested we meet up if he had the time.

When we finally met in person, it felt like we'd known each other for years. Our conversation flowed from travel stories to tech trends, and finally to the challenges we face as indie developers. Pramod shared his experiences from his multiple projects, while I talked about my learnings from Notsly. As we shared our experiences, one common pain point emerged: how difficult it was to turn our existing users into a growth engine. We both had products with happy users, but converting that satisfaction into referrals felt like an uphill battle.

That's when the lightbulb moment hit us. What if we could create a tool that made referral marketing as easy as sharing a cup of coffee? And just like that, the idea for HiveOtter was born.

What happened next still amazes me. Energized by our idea and fueled by copious amounts of Malaysian coffee, we dove headfirst into building HiveOtter. Pramod's experience from his previous projects and his tech lead background proved invaluable as we architected the solution. In just 7 days flat, we went from concept to a working prototype. We poured our hearts into creating a platform that would solve the very problems we had faced ‚Äì automating coupon codes, simplifying onboarding, and tracking referrals with precision.

Today, I'm thrilled to say that HiveOtter is more than just an idea. It's a living, breathing platform that we hope will help indie developers and small businesses grow their user base organically. Every time I see a new signup or a successful referral, I'm reminded of that serendipitous meeting in KL and the whirlwind week that followed.

But our story doesn't end here. In fact, we're just getting started. We're excited to continue refining HiveOtter based on real-world feedback from fellow indies. If you're interested in checking it out or have thoughts on referral marketing, we'd love to hear from you!

Remember, every great journey begins with a single step ‚Äì or in our case, a Twitter connection that led to an in-person meetup. Here's to the unexpected connections that lead to amazing innovations!

Content: Not sure if this is the right sub for this‚Ä¶

Anyways I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúJack of all trades master of none‚Äù

I spend most my time caring for my 2 special needs kids. So time working outside the home is limited but possible. 

So these skills are:

- Painting (everything from nails to houses) 

- Paper craft/ cardboard construction (doll miniatures to kids furniture) 

- Sewing, crochet, knitting on a semi-advanced level 

- Design (fashion, room, garden, or a digital ad) 

-  Video editing 

-  Cleaning! I‚Äôm OCD and know every cleaning hack out there for your car or house.

- Light construction/ landscaping. I can do any finishing work, basic wood working, painting, tiles, masonry, floors, appliance install etc. basic plumbing exp.

These two I have no passion for but people have always told me I should

- Cook. I can definitely cook, ngl.
But I avoid the food business like the plague 

- Writing. I‚Äôve had people including writers tell me I should get into it. Not like fiction, like wiki pages and articles- But I‚Äôm not sure where to even start on that..the google advice is pretty generic. 

I have been a mess on where to focus my energy any ideas are appreciated. 




EDIT: I forgot aquarium stuff, done some *adult* work online, furniture flipping, also I enjoy accounting/budgeting for fun..no degree.

Comment by TorrentialStorms: I would make a list, firstly write down what you enjoy the most. Second what you‚Äôre best at doing and third what will make you the most money. 

Choose something on/or at the top of all 3 lists and focus there.

Comment by Phantom2317: You can make $60-$70 an hour (potentially more after experience) doing side jobs for yardwork/landscaping, appliance installation, tile, carpentry, etc. I started doing this on the side, and eventually quit my regular job to start my own business for it. You don't need to go all in like I did, but even a couple small side jobs a week will be a nice bonus.

Comment by bugbear4242: Freelance writing or content creation might be worth exploring. You could start small by offering services on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr.  I'd suggest focusing on topics you‚Äôre passionate about as you're more likely to be successful if you can serve a niche rather than trying to be a master-of-all.

Comment by Thejenfo: I‚Äôve done this but I run into a couple walls.

I really like using the ikigai method 

But I run into a blank on the ‚Äúwhat does the world need?‚Äù Part

I‚Äôm basically a crafter, the world doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù art..

Then I struggle with which of my skills is truly the most lucrative- or worth the time if you will

Comment by Thejenfo: Yes! when my son was a newborn the bulk of our income was doing odd jobs like this. 

I have 10-20 yrs experience with basic carpentry work, flooring and paint/drywall. I know these trades have value‚Ä¶

Probs are I don‚Äôt have many tools rn, and childcare is a factor. (Trying to get them in school) 

Definitely not off my list, I could swing a couple jobs a week. Plus I plan to rebuild my tool collection for a house build anyhow so there‚Äôs that!

Comment by Thejenfo: I would like to try writing!

I‚Äôve done content creation. First I did the adult work, which was lucrative. 

then the nail thing‚Ä¶ which tbh it was more discouraging than I thought. I didn‚Äôt realize when you sell ‚Äúsexy‚Äù how much faster things move along. 

Neither one felt right.. nothing ever feels quite right - hence the doing it all üòµ‚Äçüí´

Comment by Phantom2317: I'd recommend checking out the app TaskRabbit. It's a great way to connect to new clients, and there's plenty of opportunities that require no/minimal tools to start off. Plus you set your own availability hours that you're able to get hired for! I did this when I was starting out my business, and Its a phenomenal way to meet new clients without investing money into marketing. I then convert them over to my company off app, gaining an extra $10/hr (TR collects $20/hr as the middle man, I split the difference so clients end up paying $10 less per hour.)
